## 1. Overview

The PTSafe mobile is created in order to satisfy the business stakeholders requirements as well as to meet the expectations of the pre-defined user story and acceptance criteria. It is generated in a form of an android mobile application, and it is connected to the data source in a form of dedicated API built on top of NodeJS-Express framework and Flask to expose the object detection API (can be found [here](https://github.com/ymul0001/ptsafe-backend)). Meanwhile, the android application is deployed on Google Cloud’s Firebase and distributed via App Distribution module

## 2. Software Architecture and Design Principle Involved
The mobile application is created with Java programming language as the main language, and it is built inside the the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called Android Studio. During the development of the mobile application, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm is strictly followed, as all android components are available in a form of Interfaces and classes.

Second, the mobile application is established by following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. It is no different from MVC, in which all responses generated by back-end services are mapped to models before being rendered into the view components. Moreover, to handle complicated background asynchronous processes, threading paradigm is utilised in order to minimalise the multithreading risk of the application.

Meanwhile, the mobile application is also strictly follows the single responsibility principle from the SOLID principle. It is reflected on the current software architecture code that implements different Java classes for different types view and fragment components.
